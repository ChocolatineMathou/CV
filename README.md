## Hobbies and interests

- Travel: I love discovering new places. For a holiday or just a weekend with a backpack in Europe, I'm always ready to go on an adventure. During my spare time, I'm still exploring London.
- Photography: Wherever I go I always have my camera in my bag and share my photographs on [this tumblr](http://photomathou.tumblr.com/).
- Cooking: Daughter of a French cook, I spend loads of time in my kitchen. During the past months, baking *chouquettes* has been my favorite activity to fight anxiety. I remain Queen of the Fondant Baulois.

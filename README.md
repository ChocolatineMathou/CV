I'm a full stack developer who recently graduated from [Makers](https://makers.tech/) with a background on digital communication for the railway and health industries. I also worked on a sponsorship between SNCF (French Railway Company) and [HackPartners](https://github.com/mathildeferrandcoeurderoy/CV#experience) to bring the hackathon culture to the french railway industry! **HackTrain 5.0: 48 hours, 80 developers, 30 mentors, 20 prototypes, 2 trains**. This year I'm tackling the challenge as a software engineer!   
I am now looking for challenging work in an environment that will push me to improve my technical skills and grow as a developer with a strong communication-based culture.

## Skills

#### Project Management

Whilst working on independent projects at Makers (like [Chitter](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/chitter-challenge) among other weekend challenges), I set my own direction and managed to deliver what I wanted to achieve.   
At SNCF (French Railway Company), I had to deal between multiple projects at the same time, from writing contents to managing a sponsorship agreement involving several departments within the company.

#### Collaborative work

At Makers, we worked on three group projects focusing on engineering process and values of extreme programming. We set up agile rituals such as daily stand ups, sprint sessions and retros. I really did enjoy pairing with each member during the group projects. This enabled us to share knowledge (i.e. discovering Redux during our [final project](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/injection_dependent)) and having a clear understanding of our goals.

#### Communication
   
My previous experiences involved communicating a lot with stakeholders, especially when setting up the partnership between SNCF and HackPartners.   
At Makers, pair programming afternoons were the occasion to have open and clear conversations with my partners in order to reach a goal and solve problems.

#### Additional skills

- Languages: French (native), English (fluent), Spanish (elementary proficiency).
- Adobe Softwares: InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects.

## Experience

**Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale, Rectorat de Nantes** (April 2018 to June 2018)    
*English Teacher*  
I replaced two English teachers until the end of the year. This experience gave me more self-confidence to interact with an audience.

**SNCF** (September 2015 to July 2017)    
*Communication and Community Manager*  
At SNCF (French Railway Company), I worked for the International Department and the Train Operations (Driver Management) Department. It was my very first opportunity to work for a worldwide company.   

- I was in charge of promoting the international culture within the company by writing articles. I also analysed data from Google Analytics to understand my audience.
- Coordination of the sponsorship agreement between the three companies (SNCF, SNCF Mobilités and SNCF Réseau) and [HackPartners](https://hackpartners.com/events/hacktrain-5/) a consultancy based in London who runs an annual hackathon called HackTrain. At this time, hackathons weren't very well known in the company and I became more interested with innovation and coding.

**Imagence** (May 2015 to August 2015)   
*Junior Project Manager (internship)*  
Imagence is a small web agency based in the Greater Paris Area, working for the health industry. I managed a digital project and worked closely with back-end and front-end developers to create a new authentication system.

## Interests

- **Travel:** I love discovering new places. For a holiday or just a weekend in Europe with only a backpack, I'm always ready to go on an adventure. During my spare time, I'm still exploring London.
- **Photography:** Wherever I go I always have my camera in my bag and share my photographs on [this tumblr](http://photomathou.tumblr.com/).
- **Cooking:** Daughter of a French cook, I spend loads of time in my kitchen. During the past months, baking *chouquettes* has been my favourite activity to fight anxiety. I remain Queen of the Fondant Baulois.
